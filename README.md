# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

This repository takes in user input from pre-defined questions and creates a simple ReadMe document. It is intended to help individuals make a ReadMe file in less time, helping them spend more time on coding. 

A challenge I faced when creating this repository was taking user input for the license section and inserting the chosen type of license badge and link into the ReadMe file. For future improvements, I would like to provide a bigger selection of license options to choose from and not listing a section on the ReadMe if the user does not enter anything in that section.


## Installation

To install this repository for use, you will need to download the "code" folder in the [Professional-README-Generator](https://github.com/glchavez/Professional-README-Generator) repository. Once installed on your computer, save it in a location you would like your created ReadMe's to be saved once created.

Please note, you will need node.js to run this repository on your computer.


## Usage

To create a ReadMe file, you will need to run the index.js file in the "code" folder of the Professional-README-Generator repository in your terminal. In the terminal, enter "node index.js". This will start the list of questions that asks the user what they would like to be included for each section of their ReadMe. Once all of the questions have been answered, a ReadMe will be created on your computer. You can then move the ReadMe to the desired folder on your computer.

The created ReadMe will look as such:

## Credits

I would like to provide credit to [The Denver Univeristy Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/) for providing me with the materials, intstructions, and one-on-one assistance to perform this project.

Recognition is provided to [Lukas-h](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) on GitHub Gist for providing me with resources to include license badges and website links in the ReadMe document.
